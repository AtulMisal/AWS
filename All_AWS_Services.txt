1. Amazon Lambda -
   "ELB is a load balancing service provided by AWS which distributes incoming traffic across several targets such as EC2 instance, Lambda function etc"
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service by AWS
  	Developers do not need worry about which resources to lunch, or how to manage them.
	  All they must do is just put the code on AWS Lambda and it should work.

2. Elastic Load Balancer -
    We have deployed our application on a server and there some chances by which it will stop working& these are -
     1. Sudden spike in app. traffic
	   2. App. crash due to unknown reasons.
	   3. EC2 instance crash
	  coz of these our application might not work so to avoid this we use ELB.
    It will balances the incomming load on app so that it will not crash.
  
   With the help of Auto-Scaling we will balance the no of instance to handle the traffic but with load balancer will tell the user to go on which server.

   Create an Auto-Scaling groups and will attach a load balancer to it as -
     First create auto-scalling group then go to load balancer select your load balancer which type you want.
     Click on that auto-scalling group in detailes edit and add that target group you have created.
	   Click on load balancer -> create new load balancer -> add target group -> these target groups will point to auto-scalling group
	   To do this goto auto-scalling part in that select your group -> details -> edit -> add target group -> save
	 Now as we want to revert user on that website that they want to access so goto load balancer select that -> listener -> click on view/edit rule -> save  
   Types -
   1. Classic load balancer
	 2. Network load balancer
	 3. Application load balancer
	 4. Getway load balancer

3. Amazon Autoscaling -
      It ensuers that you have enough EC2 instances available to handle the load of your application by launching or terminating EC2 instance automatically.
	  To do this go to autoscaling part add configuration here which AMI you want also after which threshold you have to increase/decrease your instance number.

4. Amazon elastic compute cloud -
       It is a web service that provides secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
   Instance -
        It is a virtual server for running applications on EC2.

        It is an template that containes server configuration(OS,Application,Application Server) required to launch your instance.		

6. Elastic Beanstalk -
        AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an AWS managed service for web applications. Elastic beanstalk is a pre-configured EC2 server 
		that can directly take up your application code and environment configurations and use it to automatically provision 
		and deploy the required resources within AWS to run the web application.
    As this is PaaS type of model wit provides dashboard level of access.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	What Is The Difference Between AWS Elastic Beanstalk And Amazon Ec2?
        EC2 allows creating a server in the AWS cloud where the user has to pay on an hourly basis.
        Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that contains an optional database and AWS components 
		    such as an Auto-Scaling Group, Elastic Load Balancer,  Security Group. It manages these items whenever 
	    	you want to update the software running in AWS. 	
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS Storage Services -

  What is AWS Cloud Storage?
    Cloud storage is a cloud computing model that enables storing data and files on the internet through a cloud computing 
	provider that you access either through the public internet or a dedicated private network connection.
	
Storage service -
   1. EBS -
       As the name suggest this is a type of block storage that is made for using with EC2. It comes as attached to EC2 just like hard drive attached to your system.
	   It is persistent in nature.
	   
   2. EC2 (Root Volume)
   
   3. S3 -
        It is a simple storage which is used to store files and other data. It is costly. We can store any kind of data.
   
   4. Glacier -
        This service provides archival storage. Means you can store a data which is not frequently accessed.
   
   5. EFS -
   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS Security Services -
 1. IAM -
      With the help of this we will provide the necessory access to the users.

    A VPC is a virtual network which enbles to launch aws resources into it.
	There are two types of VPC's 
	  1. Default VPC - Created by default when aws account is created.
	  2. Non default VPC - Which will be created by the user.
	VPC is created in aws region. Subnets covers diff AZ's. One subnet for one AZ.
	
2. Rout 53 -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

AWS CloudWatch - (Monitoring tool)
    It provides real time monitoring of AWS resources & customer application running on Amazon infrastructure.
	
	We are using this service coz suppose we have deployed our application on server in day time the app utilization is more as compared to night but since we are not using 
	any monitoring tool we will have to pay same amount as we are paying in day time and to avoid this we are using CloudWatch service.
	Also with this service we will know if our app is down then the cause will be shown by this service to us.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AWS CloudFormation -
       A complex application on AWS will have many other aws resources and to manage them is a very difficult task to do this we will use CloudFormation.
       
	   It is a service that helps you to model and set up your AWS resources so that you can spend less time on managing those resources & give more time to 
	   you application that runs on AWS.
	   
	   Will create templates in this and we will add other resources to this template.
	   A template uses json script.
	   
	   Here we have to create a template by drag and drop activity.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
