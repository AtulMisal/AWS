1. Amazon Lambda -
   "ELB is a load balancing service provided by AWS which distributes incoming traffic across several targets such as EC2 instance, Lambda function etc"
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service by AWS
	Developers do not need worry about which resources to lunch, or how to manage them.
	All they must do is just put the code on AWS Lambda and it should work.

2. Elastic Load Balancer -
    We have deployed our application on a server and there some chances by which it will stop working& these are -
       1. Sudden spike in app. traffic
	   2. App. crash due to unknown reasons.
	   3. EC2 instance crash
	coz of these our application might not work so to avoid this we use ELB.
    It will balances the incomming load on app so that it will not crash.
  
   With the help of Auto-Scaling we will balance the no of instance to handle the traffic but with load balancer will tell the user to go on which server.

   Create an Auto-Scaling groups and will attach a load balancer to it as -
     First create auto-scalling group then go to load balancer select your load balancer which type you want.
     Click on that auto-scalling group in detailes edit and add that target group you have created.
	   Click on load balancer -> create new load balancer -> add target group -> these target groups will point to auto-scalling group
	   To do this goto auto-scalling part in that select your group -> details -> edit -> add target group -> save
	 Now as we want to revert user on that website that they want to access so goto load balancer select that -> listener -> click on view/edit rule -> save  
   Types -
     1. Classic load balancer
	 2. Network load balancer
	 3. Application load balancer
	 4. Getway load balancer
3. Amazon Autoscaling -
      It ensuers that you have enough EC2 instances available to handle the load of your application by launching or terminating EC2 instance automatically.
	  To do this go to autoscaling part add configuration here which AMI you want also after which threshold you have to increase/decrease your instance number.

4. Amazon elastic compute cloud -
       It is a web service that provides secure,resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
   Instance -

		that can directly take up your application code and environment configurations and use it to automatically provision 
		and deploy the required resources within AWS to run the web application.
           As this is PaaS type of model wit provides dashboard level of access.
    
	What Is The Difference Between AWS Elastic Beanstalk And Amazon Ec2?
        EC2 allows creating a server in the AWS cloud where the user has to pay on an hourly basis.
        Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment that contains an optional database and AWS components 
		such as an Auto-Scaling Group, Elastic Load Balancer,  Security Group. It manages these items whenever 
		you want to update the software running in AWS.

AWS CloudWatch - (Monitoring tool)
    It provides real time monitoring of AWS resources & customer application running on Amazon infrastructure.
	
	We are using this service coz suppose we have deployed our application on server in day time the app utilization is more as compared to night but since we are not using 
	any monitoring tool we will have to pay same amount as we are paying in day time and to avoid this we are using CloudWatch service.
	Also with this service we will know if our app is down then the cause will be shown by this service to us.
	
First create an service on which you want to add it to Cloud Watch. Copy instance id
Go to Cloud Watch - Matrics - Paste that instance id - select on which basis you want to add - select cpu (If want select more)-
Then click on action create dashboard if you want to create new dashboard.
Now create an alarm - On which basis you want this - Email/text - for email - create SNS service add topic - in subscription add your mail - confirm that -
add this sns in alarm - what you have to do if this alarm happens - delete ec2 instance.
